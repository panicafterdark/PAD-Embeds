As such we must enforce these.**\nðŸ”¸***Three strikes and you're out!***\n\nðŸ”¹ Be excellent to each other and to the staff. Respect other players' and their boundaries. Harassment and bullying of other players is not tolerated in our venue. Please keep your drama outside of our venue, it will not be tolerated. Do not purposefully come to meme/bombard our venue, everyone is here to have a good time.\nðŸ”¹ Don't godmod/powerplay. Don't control another person's character, you can only control yours. If you want something to affect your character that affects' another person's you must get permission too.\nðŸ”¹ In-character (IC) and out-of-character (OOC) do not correlate. Please do not allow outside OOC issues to affect IC content. In regards to what was stated before as well, do not take negative character relations (CR) personally; always keep in mind that negative CR with other characters does not mean the players dislike you.\nðŸ”¹ Donâ€™t infomod. Just because you know something about a players character that was shared with you in an OOC setting doesnâ€™t mean your character knows. If you wish to divulge something about a character that you learned out of the game then run it by the player before doing so.",
